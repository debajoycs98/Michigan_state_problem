The problem is given a nxd x nxd structured matrix where every non overlapping dxd element is a diagonal matrix. 

The purpose of this repo is to solve this problem using matrix data structure.

In this data structure each element is a diagonal matrix and hence we define 
elementary operations of a diagonal matrix and use them such that they are efficient.

Basic Steps:
